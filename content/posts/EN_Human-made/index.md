Almost everyone — at least anyone who’s tried using AI to create something more ambitious than simple texts or code — knows that while it can certainly help, relying on it entirely tends to be… shall we say, overly optimistic. And the more complex the subject, the more “creative” the AI’s mistakes tend to be. Give it a prompt on everyday life, gadgets, or IT — areas endlessly covered across the Internet — and it performs quite decently, even impressively. But touch on something like industrial mechanics or chemistry, and it may display all the agility of a penguin… in a ballroom, not when fishing under the ice (though its tailcoat remains impeccable in both settings).

I suppose that, given server access, a today’s AI agent could deploy a Kafka cluster without breaking a sweat. Yet hand it a machine tool, even one with digital control, and ask to produce an ordinary ball bearing — and you’ll likely find yourself nostalgic for the reassuring certainty of the previous century. Let’s not even mention a gearbox with specified characteristics… There, I’m afraid, it would be easier to teach a walrus embroidery. On your own, without AI’s assistance.

What bothers me most is this: AI-generated text often reads effortlessly, sometimes even pleasantly. Smooth as butter, clear as spring water, and occasionally seasoned with a hint of self-assurance (often misplaced, though). The trouble starts when such texts become the basis for real decisions, plans — or worse, actual work. That’s when one learns the difference between “sounds good, easy to follow” and “accurate and correct.”.

I earn my living as a technical writer and documentation specialist. My prose doesn’t elevate readers or move them to catharsis. It serves a humbler miracle — helping skilled, intelligent people avoid costly mistakes. Of course, I turn to AI for assistance, drawing on the immense knowledge poured into it. Yet I like to think I understand my subjects well enough never to trust the machine entirely. When working with AI, I treat it as an overly enthusiastic intern — one who has read every book ever written but, though quite clever, hasn’t truly understood a single one. Everything must be checked, the logic rebuilt, the terminology leveled, the stylistic excesses trimmed. Fortunately, in this tandem, I am (apparently…for now, at least…) still the senior partner. I like to think the AI, even if slightly offended, is nonetheless grateful for my patience..

All the materials on this site I prepare myself. For the portions where AI lends a hand — say, helping with metaphors in this posting — I perform a full editorial detox. In such cases (which is to say, nearly always), I mark them as “Human made”. Like this:

{{< callout type="custom" emoji="✍️👤" title="Human made." text="NO ADDED AI HALLUCINATIONS." style="background-color: transparent; border: 5px solid #185ABD;" >}}

Don’t be alarmed by the lists, icons, or em dashes across this site — those are mine, not the AI’s. Still, you’ll surely find something to question, correct or improve; after all, that’s a reader’s natural sport.

By the way, in my other works, even when such marks aren’t present (usually there’s simply no space for them), I follow the same rule: read carefully, edit thoroughly, and never assume the AI knows what it’s talking about.

Because, between us, dear reader — it rarely does.
